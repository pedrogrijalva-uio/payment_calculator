# payment_calculator

## Overview of the solution
The application implements the use of OOP but also uses scripts for features like reading the payments file and data classification according the requirements.
The rest of the application executes the data classification according to the structure of the data in the payments file.
I have implemented part of the code using TDD but because of the time limitation some features does not have tests.
As the instructions declare, you do not need to install any dependencies. You just need to use the Python installation in your local machine.

## Running instructions
`
$ python -m app <file-paht>
`
## Running the unit tests

`
$ python3 -m unittest -v
`
